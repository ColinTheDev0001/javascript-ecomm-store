**A Simple ecommerce App With Shopping Cart**

Colt Steele’s “The Modern Javascript Bootcamp” 2020

This is an commerce app that uses a node.js web server to serve the html pages that allows users to shop for items and add to a cart.

Each item in the app shows an image of the product, a title and a price.

Under each item is an add to cart button when, when clicked, adds the item to the shopping cart.

There is also a “cart” link that goes to a shopping cart page that lists their items and allows the user to checkout and buy the items.

The user also has the option to remove any items from the cart.

The “buy” button isn’t connected as the project is about creating a web server and dynamically showing html pages.

On the backend of the app is a secure login, admin section where the owner of the website can edit, add and remove products.

By building this I learned how to set up Javascript projects with directories, package.json, dependencies and the use of a start script which runs the app.

Also how to:

* Structure Javascript projects
* Create a web server
* Parse form data
* Use product grade authentication
* Work with images


The next thing to do for this project so it is useful for a commercial project is to add a functioning checkout with payment details.

You need node.js, express, nodemon and npm to run the app.
